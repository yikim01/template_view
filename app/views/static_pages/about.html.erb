<h1>ABOUT</h1>
<p>Hello, hello all! Just a little about me.  I was raised in Virginia for about 23 years of my life in a small suburb.  I was certain of the direction of where my life was headed but after a while I was starting to feel lost and felt like I didn't belong there anymore.  I started traveling all over the states and lived in Seoul, Korea for about 10 months traveling to China and Japan as well and eventually going back "home".  Long story short, got depressed staying in Virginia so made a little road trip to California and just stayed.  Cities full of people and different walks of life.</p>
<p>I am currently a student again but not at your typical college or community college.  Instead it's an 12 week crash course on web development. Why did I choose this? Well, I ask myself the same question everyday.  Its full of struggles but when you hit a rewarding moment it is just wonderful.</p>
